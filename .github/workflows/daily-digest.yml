 weekday at 5pm CT. You can also trigger it manually from the GitHub UI anytime.
To set this up:

Create a GitHub repo and add both files (digest.py at the root, .github/workflows/daily-digest.yml for the workflow).
Add your Anthropic API key as a GitHub secret: go to your repo → Settings → Secrets → New secret → name it ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
Connect your HubSpot and Slack integrations to your Anthropic account at console.anthropic.com — this is what allows Claude to make the same tool calls it made in this conversation.
Push to GitHub and the schedule kicks in automatically. You can also hit "Run workflow" manually to test it.
One important note: The tool integrations (HubSpot + Slack) need to be configured at the API level in your Anthropic account. This is currently available via Anthropic's connector/integration settings — want help thinking through that step, or any other part of the setup?

how do I add files to my repo?

Here are a few ways to do it, depending on your comfort level:

Option 1 — GitHub web UI (easiest, no setup needed)

Go to your repo on github.com
Click Add file → Create new file
Name the file (e.g. digest.py), paste in the code, and click Commit changes
Repeat for the workflow file — but for that one, you need to type the full path in the filename field: .github/workflows/daily-digest.yml (GitHub will automatically create the folders)
Option 2 — GitHub Desktop (good if you prefer a visual app)

Download GitHub Desktop
Clone your repo locally
Add the files to the folder on your computer
In GitHub Desktop, write a commit message and click Commit → Push
Option 3 — Git CLI (most control)

bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
# add your files here, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Add daily digest automation"
git push
For your situation, Option 1 is probably the quickest since you only have two files. Do you have a GitHub repo already created, or do you need help setting that up first?
